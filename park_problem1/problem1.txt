This is a warning that you have too many absences and/or have not completed course requirements; therefore, the quality of your academic performance is suffering. You are subject to being withdrawn. Please review the policies in my course syllabus and, if you wish to continue with the class, arrange a conference with me to discuss your status by due date. On the other hand, if you choose to withdraw from the class, it is your responsibility to withdraw through your Atlas account. You may withdraw yourself only before the withdrawal deadline, and you will receive a grade of W.
If I withdraw you after the withdrawal deadline for excessive absences, you will receive a W for the course. Any student who withdraws or is withdrawn from a class during a third or subsequent attempt in the same course will be assigned a grade of F.
If you are on a Bright Futures scholarship, you will be responsible for reimbursing the college for the tuition and fees associated with this class if you earn a W or F grade in the class.
